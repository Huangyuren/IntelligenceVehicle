# IntelligenceVehicle
## Code for NTU 2020 spring course, Intorduction to Intelligent Vehicles.
* HW1.cpp is a TDMA communication protocol implementation.
* HW2.cpp is about Simulated annealing for priority assignment. Continuing HW2, we perform simulated annealing for finding nearly optimal(shortest overall elapsed time) solution of priority assignment on vehicles' CAN bus.
* HW3.cpp is for graph cycle removal, namely, we do dfs cycle checking on a provided directed graph. (also applicable for undirected graph, along with few adjustment.
